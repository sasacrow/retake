          <h2>Haarlem</h2>
          <p>
            Haarlem, capital city of the province Noord-Holland. It is a medium
            sized city, with around 160.000 inhabitants and is known to have a
            good atmosphere. If you want to go shopping, Haarlem is your place
            to be, with something for every target group. In 1994, 2004 and 2005
            it was proclaimed as the best shopping city of The Netherlands.

            <h3>Windmill De Adriaan</h3>
            <p>
              One of Haarlem’s most distinctive sights is the
              <a href="https://www.molenadriaan.nl/en/" target="_blank"
                >De Adriaan Windmill</a
              >. Located on the banks of the river Spaarne, it is a
              quintessentially Dutch landmark, and a guided tour should not be
              missed on your trip to Haarlem. From the top of the mill, you have
              a fantastic view of the historic city centre, along the banks of
              the river and beyond.

          <br><header><h2>HWA-RANG DRAGON</h2>
          <p>Hwa-Rang Dragon is a martial art school in the Schalkwijk from Haarlem. It specialises in 
          Taekwondo, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Mudo. The school offers lessons for both adults and children 
          in all of sports stated. But what exactly are these sports and what's the difference between all 
          of them? Here's an explanation: Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a martial art and combat sport system that focuses on grappling with 
          particular emphasis on ground fighting. Brazilian jiu-jitsu was developed from Kodokan judo 
          ground fighting (newaza) fundamentals that were taught by a number of Japanese individuals 
          including Takeo Yano, Mitsuyo Maeda, Soshihiro Satake, and Isao Okano. Brazilian jiu-jitsu 
          eventually came to be its own defined combat sport through the innovations, practices, and 
          adaptation of judo. </p></header>
