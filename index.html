          <h2>Haarlem</h2>
          <p>
            Haarlem, capital city of the province Noord-Holland. It is a medium
            sized city, with around 160.000 inhabitants and is known to have a
            good atmosphere. If you want to go shopping, Haarlem is your place
            to be, with something for every target group. In 1994, 2004 and 2005
            it was proclaimed as the best shopping city of The Netherlands.

            <h3>Windmill De Adriaan</h3>
            <p>
              One of Haarlem’s most distinctive sights is the
              <a href="https://www.molenadriaan.nl/en/" target="_blank"
                >De Adriaan Windmill</a
              >. Located on the banks of the river Spaarne, it is a
              quintessentially Dutch landmark, and a guided tour should not be
              missed on your trip to Haarlem. From the top of the mill, you have
              a fantastic view of the historic city centre, along the banks of
              the river and beyond.
